If you are building a bot for Skype, your bot can communicate with users via audio call. 
Audio calls are useful when the user does not want to or cannot provide input by typing, tapping, or clicking.  

A bot may support other user controls such as rich cards or text in addition to audio calls, or communicate through audio calls only.
