To fully test a bot that requests payment, [configure](~/bot-service-manage-channels.md) 
it to run on channels that support Bot Framework payments, like Web Chat and Skype. 
Alternatively, you can test your bot locally using the [Bot Framework Emulator](~/bot-service-debug-emulator.md).

> [!TIP]
> Callbacks are sent to your bot when a user changes data or clicks **Pay** during the payment web experience. 
> Therefore, you can test your bot's ability to receive and process callbacks by interacting with the payment web experience yourself.
