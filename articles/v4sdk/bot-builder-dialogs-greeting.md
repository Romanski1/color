# Implement a greeting dialog

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](../includes/pre-release-label.md)]

You can use a dialog to welcome a user to a conversation.

For more information about welcoming users, see how to [send welcome messages to users][send-welcome].

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of [managing state][concept-state], the [dialogs library][concept-dialogs], how to [manage conversations][simple-flow], and how to [gather user input using a dialog prompt][prompting].
- A copy of the ??? sample in either [**CSharp**][cs-sample] or [**JavaScript**][js-sample].

## \<task> [as in to do X, do these things]

<!--The key lines of code for this task.
    here are the cool lines that do that.
    just the few lines of implementation without setup.
-->

## About the sample code

<!--setup & implementation & discussion of the sample code-->

- Additional packages needed (AI.Luis, Dialogs, etc.)

<!--Any other key elements to get the code to work.
    Include setup for only the bits critical to the task at hand.
    don't go over all the code in the sample.
-->

## To test the bot

1. If you have not done so already, install the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/bot-framework-emulator-readme).
1. Run the sample locally on your machine.
1. Start the emulator, connect to your bot, and send messages as shown below.

TODO: Take new screenshot.

## Discussion [optional]

<!--Might be short and descriptive or include additional code for scenarios not covered in the samples repo
-->

## Addition information

<!--include cross-linking other articles about the same sample.-->

- link to the "about the core bot" landing page for the overall sample (for CoreBot-derived articles).
