# Virtual Assistant - Getting Started

In order to help you get started with building your own Virtual Assistant we have a set of [tutorials](https://github.com/microsoft/AI/tree/master/docs#tutorials) available as part of the [Bot Framework Solutions GitHub repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-solutions). These enable you to build your own assistant in around 10 minutes and then move on to customisation and as needed adding/building additional skills.

In addition the above documentation has further [How-To](https://github.com/microsoft/AI/tree/master/docs#how-to) and [Reference](https://github.com/microsoft/AI/tree/master/docs#reference) documentation that goes into more detail.
