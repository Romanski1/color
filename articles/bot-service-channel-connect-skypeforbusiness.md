# Connect a bot to Skype for Business

Skype for Business Online keeps you connected with co-workers and business partners through instant messaging, phone, and video calls. Extend this functionality by building bots that users can discover and interact with through the Skype for Business interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Skype for Business channel in Bot Framework is being deprecated on June 30, 2019.**
> 
> No new bots will be able to add Skype for Business channel after that date.  Existing bots will continue to work until October 31, 2019. Microsoft Teams is the preferred communication tool from Microsoft.  Learn how to [connect your bot to Microsoft Teams](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/bots).

## Enable the channel

Open the bot in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click the **Channels** blade, and then click **Skype for Business**. The bot is now enabled. 

Connecting the bot with Skype for Business Online is performed by a **Tenant Administrator** of that Skype for Business tenant.
